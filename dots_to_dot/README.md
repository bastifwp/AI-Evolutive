# Dots_to_dot

An implementation of an evolutive algorithm is implemented. Several dots are generated with random movements. The dot that finishes the closest to the objective dot will go to the next generation, where the parents are mutated to create new dots.  

A few obstacles where added and the algorithm seems to struggle to converge into a solution quickly. This may be due to the lack of a crossover operation or because of the definition of the fitness functions (distance to goal).

The project was made in processing in case you would like to run it and test it :)
